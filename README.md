# Cybersecurity_report

This repository contains a complete collection of all the practical tasks, reports and hands-on assessments I completed during my cybersecurity internship at ShadowFox.

Over the course of the internship, I explored real-world attack scenarios from beginner-level port scanning and traffic interception, to intermediate-level encryption cracking and reverse shell exploitation and finally, advanced web application attacks including SQL Injection, LFI and authentication bypass.

Each report in this repo reflects my learning curve as I transitioned from understanding tools to thinking like an ethical hacker all while documenting every step with structured analysis and responsible disclosure.

This internship shaped my foundation in offensive security and gave me a deeper appreciation for what it truly takes to secure systems.
